# This batch builds the C++ library, all C++ examples, documentation, and the Python library.
# Note that kdp.cpp (the cpp code generated by Cython for kdp), 
# and thus module kdp, will only be updated if Cython exists on the system:
#		sudo yum install Cython
make all

python3 setup_kdp.py build_ext --build-lib=./lib
python2 setup_kdp.py build_ext --build-lib=./lib
